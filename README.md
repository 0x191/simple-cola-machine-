# simple-cola-machine-
cola machine I made in 10 mins, language is c++

Its pretty much as basic as it can get, prompts the user welcome and then asks to choose a beverage thats listed below 
if they choose a valid beverage, it runs successful, if not gives them error and returns money back. 

tell me how you like it, thanks.
